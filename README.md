# pomodoro

Javascript exercise to create a 'pomodoro' clock. I used jquery selectors here for practice. Functions well.

The idea of the pomodoro cycle is to convince yourself to be productive with the promise of a break. Typically 25 minutes of productivity followed by a 5 minute break.
I have this set to loop infinitely.
